# beeli
script to scrape lichess as an api data source for beeminder and check every hour or so using a heroku dyno

uses matt joyce's very useful beeminderpy (https://github.com/mattjoyce/beeminderpy) with minor tweaks for python3

and robert grant's excellent berserk https://github.com/rhgrant10/berserk for pulling data from the lichess api
